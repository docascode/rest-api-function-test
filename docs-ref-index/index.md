# Power BI REST APIs

Power BI REST API provides service endpoints to Power BI resources. To learn more, see [Getting started with REST](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/).

Power BI REST operations require an Azure Active Directory (AAD) access token. To learn more about how to authenticate to the Power BI service, see [Authenticate to Power BI service](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/get-azuread-access-token).
